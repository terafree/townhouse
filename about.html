        <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have successfully developed computers labs, 3D printing Product Design areas, and computer media classes from the most expensive private schools to the eastside of San Francisco. I have been awarded with many grants and community partners that have supported the computer programs. I wrote the A-G UC description for Computer Art 1, the first computer arts class in California. The diversity of students and situations give me a strong understanding and skills on how technology can be used as a tool for learning in many different environments. 
          <p>
          I have strong skills in the graphic arts since I develop and design graphics and websites for clients during the summers and teach high school students Adobe applications such as PhotoShop, Illustrator, Web development, SolidWorks and Flash during the school year. I create schoolâ€™s websites and help with technical problems for staff and administrators. 
          <p>
          Through providing a network of art related opportunities for students, I help expand their possibilities or internships they never knew about to help strengthen their own view of self and the world.
